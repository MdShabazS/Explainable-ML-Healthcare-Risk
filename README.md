# Explainable ML for Healthcare Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project builds an explainable machine learning system to predict heart disease risk and provide transparent explanations for clinical decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Most medical ML models act as black boxes, making it difficult for clinicians to trust predictions.

## Dataset
UCI Heart Disease Dataset with clinical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline)
- Random Forest (black-box comparison)
- SHAP-based explainability

## Explainability
SHAP is used to explain both global feature importance and individual patient predictions.

## Results
The project demonstrates the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in healthcare ML.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Matplotlib, Jupyter

## Applications
Clinical decision support, medical AI research, ethical AI systems
